As we continue to use fossil fuels at a rate above thei replacement rate, we continue to risk reaching the point of "peak oil." This would be the point of maximum production of oil, which can only be followed by a decline in the production of oil and resources are exhausted. The inevitable consequence of this is that our energy needs will become unsustaiable, and the world as we know it will become unable to function as it has. Addtionally, fossil fuels are well known to creat a plethora of environmental toxins, such as CO2, which likely contribute to an increase in global teperatures, ocean acidification, and other accompanying issues such as unpredictable wheather patterns and coral bleaching. By pursuing and utilizing alternative energy, we may be able to replace our use of fossil fuels with clean, sustainable energy that would leave us as a planet secure in the face of peak oil and would allow us to pursue the mitigation of the environmental concerns we are currently facing.
