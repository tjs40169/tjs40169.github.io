What is tidal energy?
Tidal energy refers to energy produced by the movement of water through a turbine. This form of energy converts the kinetic energy of the ocean into electrical energy that can be used in homes and businesses. Tidal energy is increasingly viable as a form of alternative energy, though our ability to harness tidal energy (which relates to costal area and availability) will never allow it to be one of the predominant forms of energy (at least, not any time soon). There are three main methods of harvesting tidal energy: barrages, turbines, and fences (in which vertical turbines are set up in a line).
