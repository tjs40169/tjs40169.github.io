What are fuel cells?
A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that converts chemical energy to electrical energy. They work similar to batteries, but can use fuel sources such as hydrogen. At the moment, these are not the most competative form of energy, however with time, development, and inovations in the way of increasing convinience and making implementation more realistic, these could be a solid clean fuel source. Hydrogen fuel cells, for example, produce no heat and only water as a byproduct, and requires only hydrogen and oxygen to fuel it. This could be a significant change in the way of clean and renewable energy as it is fairly cheap and produces no toxic byproduct. However, there are many different types of fuel cells that may be viable for a number of applications, but the technology still isn't quite ready for mass and comercial use.
