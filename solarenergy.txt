What is solar energy?
This one is pretty simple: solar energy is any type of energy obtained from the sun. This includes even processes such as photosynthesis, however, it is also considered more in the ways it can be utilized by humans. The primary and most widly used method of harnessing solar energy is the solar cell. These are made by various conductive and semiconductive layers that, upon recieving energy from the sun, are able to produce electrical energy. This is the most widely available and useable method of harnessing solar energy, and, since energy is converted directly from the sun to electrical energy, produces no byproduct. However, it is important to note that the production and disposal of the solar cells themselves may pose environmental problems in other ways.
