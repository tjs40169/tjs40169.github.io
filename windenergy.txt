What is wind energy?
Once again, this one is as simple as it sounds. In the context of alternative energy, the kinetic energy of the wind can be harnest very similarly to tidal energy: as wind presses through a wind turbine, it spins the turbine creating kinetic energy, which the turbine then converts to electric energy. Once again, since there is no chemical reaction taking place, this process has no toxic chemical byproducts. However, there are complaints regarding wind turbines due to the noise pollution the create (though the sound produced is generally similar to most farm equipment), and the visual burden they create.
