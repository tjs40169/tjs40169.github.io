<tr><td colspan=2>Essentially, the alternative energy offers clean (CO<sub>2</sub>-free) and sustainable sources of energy which are becoming increasingly important, and may even be vital in the near future.</td><td rowspan=8><img src="environment.jpg" alt="environment" height="650" width="450"></td></tr>

<tr><td>What <i>is</i> "Alternative Energy"?  Well, here are some examples:<ul><li>Tidal Energy <a href="tidalenergy.txt">(Click here to read more)</a></li><li>Fuel Cells <a href="solarenergy.txt">(Click here to read more)</a></li><li>Wind Energy <a href="windenergy.txt">(Click here to read more)</a></li><li>Hydroelectic Energy <a href="hydroelectricpower.txt">(Click here to read more)</a></li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>It is important to keep in mind that most sources of energy have benefits and costs. Many worry that overimplementing these new forms of energy creation or implementing them too fast may lead to greater environmental and economic concerns. Especially given the global economic dependence on fossil fuels and the convinience we have experienced them, it is likely to be a difficult transition away from fossil fuels. However, as long as we keep researching and continuously implementing these newer, cleaner renewable energy sources, the adjustment should be more than possible.</td></tr>
<tr><td>So, what can <i>you</i> do? It can seem daunting when you first start looking at a gaining interest in alternative energy. It is impossible for one person to end global dependence on oil or coal and make large nations like the United State adapt to more sustainable resources. However, there are some things everyone can do on an individual level to help. It can be as simple as reducing energy usage by turnig off lights when you leave the room or turning off the thermostat when it isn't really necessary. If you're able, you may want to invest in small solar panels of your own, and fight for legeslation that supports alternative energy and renewable resources rather than blocks it.</td></tr>
