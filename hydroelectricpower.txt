What is hydroelectric energy?
Hydroelectric energy is the energy created by the movement of water, generally through dams. Typically, water from rivers or some other type of moving water source will be pooled into a reservoir, where potential energy builds. When water flows in and out of these reservoirs, the energy created can be harnessed, typically with turbines, and converted directly to electrical energy. Once again, this process produces no byproduct, however manmade dams can cause somewhat problematic, sometimes catestrophic, damage to the ecosystems maintained by their water source. These dams can choke the rivers and streams and make them unlivable for their native species.
